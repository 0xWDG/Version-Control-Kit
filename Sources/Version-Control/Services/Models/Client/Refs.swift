    /// In Git, branch names are often represented as refs, and this function converts a local branch name into the corresponding ref syntax. It ensures that situations where the branch name is ambiguous are handled correctly.
    ///
    /// - Parameter name: The local branch name to format.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The branch name in Git ref syntax, such as `refs/heads/main`.
    ///
    /// - Example:
    ///   ```swift
    ///   let localBranchName = "main"
    ///   let formattedRef = formatAsLocalRef(name: localBranchName)
    ///   print("Local Branch: \(localBranchName), Formatted Ref: \(formattedRef)")
    ///   ```
    ///
    /// - Note:
    ///   - If the `name` already starts with `refs/heads/`, it is considered fully qualified and is returned as-is.
    ///   - If the `name` starts with `heads/`, it is formatted as `refs/heads/<name>`.
    ///   - In all other cases, `refs/heads/` is added to the beginning of the branch name.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The branch name in Git ref syntax, such as `refs/heads/main`.

    /// Read the canonical ref pointed to by a symbolic ref in the Git repository.

    /// Symbolic refs in Git are references that point to other references, similar to symbolic links in a filesystem. They provide an additional layer of indirection. This function allows you to resolve a symbolic ref to its canonical ref, providing you with the actual reference it points to.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - directoryURL: The URL of the Git repository where the symbolic ref should be resolved.
    ///   - ref: The symbolic ref to resolve.
    ///
    /// - Throws: An error if there is a problem accessing the Git repository or executing the Git command to read the symbolic ref.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The canonical ref pointed to by the symbolic ref, or `nil` if the symbolic ref cannot be found or is not a symbolic ref.
    ///
    /// - Example:
    ///   ```swift
    ///   let localRepositoryURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/local/repository")
    ///   let symbolicRefName = "HEAD" // Example symbolic ref name
    ///
    ///   do {
    ///       if let canonicalRef = try getSymbolicRef(directoryURL: localRepositoryURL, ref: symbolicRefName) {
    ///           print("Symbolic Ref: \(symbolicRefName), Canonical Ref: \(canonicalRef)")

    ///       }
    ///   } catch {
    ///       print("Error reading symbolic ref: \(error)")
    ///   }
    ///   ```
    ///
    /// - Note:
    ///   - The function executes the Git command `git symbolic-ref -q <ref>` to read the canonical ref pointed to by the symbolic ref.
    ///
    /// - Warning: Ensure that the provided `directoryURL` points to a valid Git repository directory. Failure to do so may result in errors or incorrect results.
