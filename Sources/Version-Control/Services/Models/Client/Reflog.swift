/// Get a list of the `limit` most recently checked out branches in the Git repository.
///
/// This function retrieves information from the Git logs to identify branches 
/// that were recently checked out. \
/// It is useful for tracking branch history and provides the names of branches
/// that were either checked out or renamed.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - directoryURL: The URL of the Git repository.
///   - limit: The maximum number of recently checked out branches to retrieve.
///
/// - Returns: An array of branch names that were recently checked out or renamed, with a maximum count of `limit`.
///
/// - Throws: An error if there was an issue executing the Git log command or if the output couldn't be parsed.
///
/// - Note:
///   - This function uses regular expressions to parse the Git log output, \
///     looking for branch checkout and rename events.
///   - Renamed branches are considered as part of the history, \
///     and their original names are excluded from the result to avoid duplicates.
///
/// - Example:
///   ```swift
///   let repositoryURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/git/repo")
///   let recentBranches = try getRecentBranches(directoryURL: repositoryURL, limit: 5)
///   print("Recent Branches: \(recentBranches)")
///   ```
///
/// - Returns: An array of branch names that were recently checked out or renamed, with a maximum count of `limit`.
